## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot histogram

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

## Imputing missing values


``` r
# Total number of missing values
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

```
## [1] 2304
```

``` r
# Fill NA with mean for that interval

  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(steps))

``` r

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

``` r
# Add a new column: weekday or weekend
activity_imputed$day_type <- ifelse(weekdays(as.Date(activity_imputed$date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), 
                                    "weekend", "weekday")

# Average steps by interval and day type
avg_steps_daytype <- activity_imputed %>%
  group_by(interval, day_type) %>%
  summarize(mean_steps = mean(steps))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'interval'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

``` r
# Plot
library(lattice)
xyplot(mean_steps ~ interval | day_type, data=avg_steps_daytype, type="l",
       layout=c(1,2), xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of steps")
```

## Conclusion
After imputing missing values, mean and median were slightly different.

Weekends and weekdays show different step patterns.
